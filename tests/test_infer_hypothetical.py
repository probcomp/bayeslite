'''Ensures that INFER EXPLICIT PREDICT col for a _rowid_ which exists in the
base table, but not incorporated into the generator (i.e. did not exist in the
table during INITIALIZE) correctly retrieves all other values in the row. The
test cases creates a population of (0,1) and (1,0) -- the complement function --
and ensures its recovery on a held-out test set.'''
