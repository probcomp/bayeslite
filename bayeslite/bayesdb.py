    A successful execution of a BayesDB query goes through the
    following stages:

    0. Not started
    1. Preparing cursor
    2. Result available
    3. All results consumed

    Preparing the cursor and consuming results may both be fast or
    slow, and may succeed or fail, depending on the query.  Also, the
    client may abandon some queries without consuming all the results.

    Thus, a query may experience the following transitions:

    - start: 0 --> 1
    - ready: 1 --> 2
    - error: 1 --> 0 or 2 --> 0
    - finished: 2 --> 3
    - abandoned: 2 --> 0 or 3 --> 0

    queries, override the corresponding method(s) of this interface,

    :meth:`~BayesDB.sql_trace` respectively.
